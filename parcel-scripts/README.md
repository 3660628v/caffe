# Introduction

This folder contains scripts for building parcels for cloudera manager.

# Usage

Run `./setup` to setup the environment.

Two tools are provided for develpment use:

* `./validator`: used to validate some json files. These files are required for defining parcels.
* `./make_manifest`: create the layout of a parcel repo. This is useful when publishing the parcels.
